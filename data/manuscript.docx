Abstract
System Fault detection is a tedious but mush beneficial task, especially harnessing the massive amount of data generated by variable systems to create value for technology development and business strategies. By using the state-of-art machine learning and deep neural networks, we propose a series of methods to assist in detecting system faults and gaining critically insights of log information. Here we measure the accuracy of the
